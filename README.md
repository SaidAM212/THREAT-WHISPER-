WELCOME TO MY NETWORK TRAFFIC ANALYZER PROJECT.

## üß† Network Sentinel: Adaptive Traffic Analyzer & Response Framework  
**Built by Amos | Hosted on [lovable.dev](https://lovable.dev)**

### üîê Purpose  
Network Sentinel is a modular, cross-platform traffic analysis and response engine designed for hybrid environments. It empowers defenders with real-time visibility, automated triage, and intelligent response‚Äîbridging packet-level insight with strategic decision-making.

Whether you're simulating adversarial behavior in a CTF or hardening production infrastructure, this tool adapts to your workflow.

### üß∞ Core Features

| Module | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Traffic Capture** | Uses `Npcap`, `tshark`, and custom Python wrappers to ingest live traffic across VLANs and interfaces |
| **SIEM Integration** | Pushes enriched logs to Splunk, ELK, or Wazuh via RESTful API or syslog |
| **Dashboard & Visualization** | Real-time dashboards built with Observable, Grafana, and Plotly for protocol breakdown, TCP flags, and anomaly heatmaps |
| **ML Models** | Scikit-learn and XGBoost models trained on labeled attack datasets (DDoS, port scans, brute force) with live inference |
| **Auto-Response Engine** | Python-based logic for triggering firewall rules, isolating hosts, or sending alerts via Slack/Email |
| **Red/Blue Team Simulation** | Includes CLI wrappers for `nmap`, `hping3`, and `sqlmap` to simulate adversarial traffic and test detection logic |

### üöÄ Getting Started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/network-sentinel
cd network-sentinel
bash setup.sh  # Installs dependencies, configures interfaces
python3 sentinel.py --live --interface eth0
```

---

### üìä Sample Dashboards  
- **Protocol Distribution**: Pie chart of TCP/UDP/ICMP traffic  
- **Anomaly Timeline**: ML-detected spikes with confidence scores  
- **Flag Heatmap**: SYN/ACK/RST patterns across time windows  
- **Response Log**: Actions taken (blocked IPs, alerts sent)

---

### üß† ML Model Training

```bash
python3 train_model.py --dataset datasets/ddos.csv --model xgboost
python3 sentinel.py --ml-model models/xgboost.pkl --live
```

### üõ°Ô∏è Use Cases

- SOC Analyst training with live packet inspection and alerting
- Red team simulation with automated detection and response
- GRC reporting with visual summaries of network events
- Portfolio showcase for cybersecurity roles
